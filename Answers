I ran the program > 20 times and I never got the solution in fewer than 20 guesses using the random driver class.

This is a terrible strategy, this is because you are repeating possible correct answers when you randomly change every variable of the guess

I have ran the program > 10 times and I have gotten the solution in fewer than 20 guesses every time using my solution

This strategy is good because it never repeats possible correct answers, it 'solves' each variable of the Theory 1 piece at a time and counts through the variables one at a time.
